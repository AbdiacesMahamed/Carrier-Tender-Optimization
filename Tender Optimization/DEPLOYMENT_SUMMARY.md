# ðŸš€ Streamlit Deployment Fix

## What Was Fixed:

âœ… **Project Structure**: Verified all files are in correct locations  
âœ… **Configuration**: Added `.streamlit/config.toml` for proper deployment  
âœ… **Dependencies**: Verified `requirements.txt` is properly formatted  
âœ… **Code Quality**: All imports working correctly  
âœ… **Deployment Files**: Added helpful deployment guides and checks

## Files Added/Updated:

- `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
- `check_deployment.py` - Script to verify deployment readiness
- `.gitignore` - Proper Git ignore rules

## Next Steps:

### 1. Fix Your GitHub Repository Structure

Your repository should look like this:

```
your-repo-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â””â”€â”€ other files...
```

**NOT like this:**

```
your-repo-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ Tender Optimization/
    â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
    â””â”€â”€ components/
```

### 2. Repository Setup Options:

**Option A (Recommended)**: Move files to repository root

1. Create a new repository or clean existing one
2. Upload these files directly to the root (not in a subfolder)
3. Ensure `dashboard.py` and `requirements.txt` are at the top level

**Option B**: Update Streamlit Cloud settings

1. If your repo has `Tender Optimization/` folder
2. Set main file path to: `Tender Optimization/dashboard.py`
3. Streamlit should auto-find requirements in the same folder

### 3. Deploy on Streamlit Cloud:

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Settings:
   - **Main file path**: `dashboard.py` (if files are in root)
   - **Requirements file**: Leave blank (auto-detects)
   - **Python version**: 3.9+ (default)

### 4. Common Issues and Solutions:

| Error                                     | Solution                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Optimization/requirements.txt` not found | Move files to repository root OR fix deployment path         |
| Import errors                             | Ensure `components/` folder is uploaded                      |
| Missing dependencies                      | Check `requirements.txt` is in same folder as `dashboard.py` |

## Test Before Deploying:

Run this command locally:

```bash
python check_deployment.py
```

Should show: "ðŸŽ‰ All checks passed! Ready for deployment."

## Your App Features:

âœ… **File Upload Interface**: Users can upload GVT, Rate, and Performance data  
âœ… **Flexible Sheet Detection**: Automatically handles different Excel sheet names  
âœ… **Smart Optimization**: Works with single or multiple carriers per lane  
âœ… **Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive performance score analysis  
âœ… **Cost Analysis**: Current vs optimized vs cheapest cost comparisons

The app is now deployment-ready with no hardcoded file paths! ðŸŽŠ
